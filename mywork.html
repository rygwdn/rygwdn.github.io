    <h1>My Work</h1>

    <p>
    My research and personal projects include iPhone programming, productivity software, and extending the uses of the vim editor.
    </p><p>
    I am the primary developer for the <a title="iAcadia" href="http://iacadia.acadiau.ca/">iAcadia</a> iOS application, and developing a website for the Transfer Learning Competition.
    </p><p>
    I am also a contributor to the <a title="UltiSnips" href="https://launchpad.net/ultisnips">UltiSnips</a> plugin for <a title="vim" href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a>, and a developer/maintainer of a few small plugins of my own.
    </p><p>
    You can find most of my open source work on <a title="github" href="https://github.com/rygwdn">github</a>.

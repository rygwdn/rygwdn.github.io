    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
    This is the homepage of Ryan Wooden, Nova Scotia, Canada, a Software Developer for BlackBerry.
    </p><p>
    I play guitar, although not as frequently as I'd like, and I play with computers, probably more frequently than I should.
    </p><p>
    I am a Linux user, a Python fan, and a supporter of open source software.
    </p><p>
    I strive for simplicity combined with efficiency in all that I do, be it personal or professional.
    </p><p>
    If you wish to contact me, see the contact information at the bottom of this page.
